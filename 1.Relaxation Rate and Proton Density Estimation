''' Relaxation Rate(R2star) and proton density estimation in MGRE sequences
 S(TE)=rho*exp(-R2star*TE) signal eqaution of magnitude component of complex Field.
 where S(TE) magnitude at echo time TE, rho is the proton density. the signal is exponentially decaying and 
 the decay rate is measured by the bestfit btwn pixel intensity and echotime point 
 using the 'polyfit' function in numpy '''

 #---initialize a slice with five echoes
 # a_temp=number of rows
 #b_temp=number of coloumns
 #NEchoes=number of echoes in each slice
 # this program is for a single slice 
# define an empty arry to strore the five echoes of a particular slice
Z=np.empty((a_temp,b_temp,NEchoes)) 
#rsz is the real part of the data please go through DICOM_READ_GE to get the details regardig stacking the slices
#all the five echoes of n-th slice is stored a variable Z.
Z[:,:,0]=rsz_E1[:,:,n]
Z[:,:,1]=rsz_E2[:,:,n]
Z[:,:,2]=rsz_E3[:,:,n]
Z[:,:,3]=rsz_E4[:,:,n]
Z[:,:,4]=rsz_E5[:,:,n]
### reshape and vectorize Z 
K=a_temp*b_temp
Z=abs(Z);
Z_rshp=np.reshape(Z,(K,5))
